# Week 10 Assignment

We are now in the phase of work where we are designing and creating interfaces 
for our three final projects. This week is focused on connecting a web app to our 
databases so we can run and share our work. My code for this is in app.js.
Currently, the request queries are broad, but may be focused in the future.
For more details regarding the interface design, see Week 11.
