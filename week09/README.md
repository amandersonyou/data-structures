# Week 09 Assignments

For week 9, I set up a database using PostgreSQL to record the sensor value 
(temperature) and the datetime. I have it recording ever minute because of the short 
timespan in which the kettle will impact temperature and I'd rather collect too 
much data than too little. Below are a couple of screen shots showing the database 
setup and logs. I aim to collect data for the entire month of November.
